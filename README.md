Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models

# Overview 

Using machine learning and neural networks, create a binary classifier that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.  Dataset is a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 

# Results:

- Data Preprocessing
  1. The target for the model is: IS_SUCCESSFUL
  2.The features for the model are: APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, OGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATION, ASK_AMT
  3. Input data removed from the input were: EIN and NAME.
- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  1. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? 
  2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance? mimimal results
  3. What steps did you take to try and increase model performance? keras-tuner, increased number to hidden layers and increased number to neurons

# Summary:
